NoClueLang by NoClueBruh!

<< HEAR ME OUT >>
  - This shi was made in a little less than 10 days so don't expect any revolutionary features
  - The source code is quite the italian spaghetti, clean up at your own risk
  - The language does have errors but they are lacking some info such as line number ( possible next update )
  - You may make your own version of this language if you will, just make sure to 
    leave some credit and keep the original project's name with some twist ( Such as NoClueLang++ or somethin )

<< ABOUT THE LANGUAGE >>
  - Check the documentation of the language before use!
    ( Due to the uselessness of errors )
